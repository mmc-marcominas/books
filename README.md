# Books using a Node Express template project

This project is based on a GitLab [Project Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/express).

The main idea is use some principles:

 * DRY - DonÂ´t Reivent the Well
 * KISS - Keep It Simple Sir :)
 * MVP - Minimum Viable Product

This project aims to deliver an API with books and it's authors endpoints able to:

 * list authors and books
 * post individual author and a bulk insert by upload authors file
 * post individual book

## Installing, testing and running

### Install

Change to your project directory and clone this repo.

``` bash
$ cd ~/your/projects/direcotory
$ git clone https://github.com/mmc-marcominas/books
```

Go to created books directory, checkout `feature/express` branch and install dependencies

``` bash
$ cd ~/your/projects/direcotory/books/
$ git checkout feature/express
$ npm i
```

### Run tests

``` bash
$ cd ~/your/projects/direcotory/books/
$ npm run test
```

or with coverage report

``` bash
$ cd ~/your/projects/direcotory/books/
$ npm run test:coverage
```

### Run project

``` bash
$ cd ~/your/projects/direcotory/books/
$ npm run start
```

## MVP Deliveries history

Let's stat with some minumum viable products. I'll intentionally won't start thinking on each best architectural choice to evidence what some simple decision impacts on project quality and maintenance.

Examples of `bad` decisions until now:

 * use of sqlite persistence - it's not for production porpouse but allow focus on what is important in a implementation using tables, relations, query issues that may be applyed basically in all other more maintanable and scalable solution like.
 * don't use dependency at beggining - this show impacts when unity tests must be done and some refactor effort to solve it had to be applied.
 * lack of logs - to understand what is happenig behind the scenes you must do debug it in some case because some behaviours occour due data sent do a resource, for example, add a book with a empty author name on author list.

Other decisions definitelly have a better architectural alternative but I don't really consider a `bad` decision. Use KISS approach motivated them like:

 * use Postman to test instead of start with a TDD approach allow evidence that Postman may be more than a `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` tool, for example.
 * use a `Vanilla JavaScript apporach` instead of implements `Typescript` that impacts on better definition of project models, for example. But it allows focus on strictelly necessary on JavaScript environment and will be another requirement to implemetantion understanding if applyed.

### MVP-01: GET authors endpoint

Deliveries:

 * a basic implementation that expose an author route
 * a GET endpoint that returns an author list ordered by id
 * a database in sqlite3 to store author records
 * steps documentation to do it from scratch

Delivery details are in [this MVP-01.md](./docs/MVP-01.md) doc.

### MVP-02: GET books endpoint

Deliveries:

 * a basic implementation that expose an book route
 * a GET endpoint that returns an book list ordered by id
 * a database in sqlite3 to store book records and author relation
 * filter items by book name, edition, publication year and author
 * avoid duplicated inserts

Delivery details are in [this MVP-02.md](./docs/MVP-02.md) doc.

### MVP-03: authors upload

Deliveries:

 * a POST endpoint that insert books according list uploaded in a file
 * fix tests on GET books endpoint

Delivery details are in [this MVP-03.md](./docs/MVP-03.md) doc.

### MVP-04: Other authors and books endpoints

Deliveries:

 * a POST endpoint that insert author

Delivery details are in [this MVP-04.md](./docs/MVP-04.md) doc.

### MVP-05: POST book endpoint

Deliveries:

 * a POST endpoint that insert book

   * post author
 * change upload response to JSON
 * refactor insert author method

### MVP-09: Tests with Jest

Deliveries:

 * create tests to author services
 * create tests to book services
 * configure jest in project
 * configure code coverage

Delivery details are in [this MVP-09.md](./docs/MVP-09.md) doc.
